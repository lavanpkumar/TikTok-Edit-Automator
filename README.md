# Usage
You will need ffmpeg and the cv2 and moviepy libraries as prerequisites  
Install the libraries by running this code in the terminal:  
```bash
pip install opencv-python moviepy
```
You must download ffmpeg from its website and I recommend following a guide  
Here is the ffmpeg download link: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html  
Last, but not least, make sure your video is downloaded in an mp4 file, and I recommend renaming the file name to test.mp4 or changing 2 lines of code in the program to the video file name  
With all that out of the way, it should work!
